<li>In 2011, the <span><strong><code>Moroccan Government</code></strong> </span>  was revealed to have invested 2 million euros in the “Eagle” surveillance system, which would allow the government to perform censorship and monitoring of internet traffic using deep packet inspection. Eagle was developed by  <span><strong><code>Bull Amesys</code></strong> </span>  .</li>
<li>in June 2017, an investigation by <span><code>BBC Arabic and Dagbladet</code>  </span> , a Danish newspaper, revealed that   <code>UK defense firm BAE Systems</code> had sold mass surveillance technologies —called Evident— through its Danish subsidiary ETI, to six middle <code>eastern governments</code> with questionable human rights records, including Morocco.</li>
<li>As described in a Privacy International report, <code>Morocco</code> also purchased malware from <code>Hacking Team</code> to use it against <code>journalists</code>. The Hacking Team leaks showed that the two Moroccan intelligence agencies – the <code>High Council for National Defence (CSDN) and the Directory of Territorial Surveillance (DST)</code> – have both purchased Remote Control System intrusion malware product. The CSDN first acquired it in 2009 and the DST obtained it in 2012.</li>
<li>A report by The Citizen Lab from 2015 published evidence that the <code>Conseil Superieur De La Defense Nationale (CSDN)</code>  had also used FinFisher malware produced by the `British-German Gamma group of companies -</li>
<li>In December 2015, a <code>national coalition of NGOs</code> strongly criticized the persistent legal vacuum surrounding security and intelligence agencies. In a report submitted to the UN Committee for Human Rights, <code>14 NGOs including the Moroccan Digital Rights Association</code> called on the government to comply with the requirements of international law, in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights regarding the protection of privacy.</li>
<li>During the regional and local elections of September 2015, 30,000 mobile phone lines were reportedly tapped across the country. The mass surveillance operation, ordered by the <code>Ministry of Interio</code>r, was first reported by the Assabah newspaper. The Ministry set up commissions headed by Crown Prosecutors to supervise the operation. The authorities, who acknowledged the operation, explained that the measure was dictated by “the desire to ensure a degree of transparency in the election.” The list of individuals targeted by the operation included candidates, regional or provincial party officials, in addition to local government officials and people with no direct link to the vote but whose “occupations or activities” were deemed “related to the elections,” according to the Ministry.</li>
<li>In October 2015, seven <code>activists and investigative journalists</code> including <code>historian and academic Maati Monjib, as well as investigative journalists Hicham Mansouri and Samad Aït Aïcha, and the founder of the Digital Rights Association, Hisham Almiraat,</code> were brought before the Tribunal of First Instance of Rabat and charged with “using foreign funding to undermine State security” – a charge that carries up to five years in jail. The charges were widely seen as politically motivated.The activists were involved in a program funded by Dutch NGO Free Press Unlimited, to train journalists and human rights activists on reporting techniques as well as on tactics to evade government interception, including encryption.</li>
</ul>
<p>During their interrogation by PJ officers, the activists reported being shown transcripts of their private Skype and phone calls as well as copies of email exchanges. The defendants’ lawyers also learned that at least one of the activists’ phones was tapped for a period of three months.</p>

<li>
<p>The <code>CNDP</code> reports to the Prime Minister. It is responsible for advising the <code>government and parliament</code> on bills or legislative proposals and regulations related to the processing of personal data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the law provides for exceptions and the language is left open to interpretation. For example, Article 44 states disclosure to third parties may occur without prior consent if the processing is necessary for the performance of a task of “public interest”. The law stresses, however, the importance of respecting fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In December 2015, a coalition of 14 local human rights NGOs addressed a joint report to the United Nations Human Rights Committee lamenting the fact that "to date, the CNDP has not conducted any investigation to shed light on the situation of [communications] surveillance in Morocco</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In January 2016, <code>CNDP</code> issued recommendations regarding unsolicited electronic marketing. It called for the creation of a national opt-out list in which consumers would register to stop receiving commercial marketing messages. This raised the question of a potential misuse of the database that could be exploited for the opposite of the intended purpose. The CNDP did recommend setting up a permanent working group to ensure a proper implementation of its recommendations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CNDP, whose job it is to ensure that the processing of personal data “does not violate the privacy, fundamental freedoms and human rights” of Moroccan citizens and foreign residents, seems to be taking a backseat when it comes to the <code>national ID systems</code>. Part of CNDP’s apparent reluctance stems from the fact that the law restricts its scope of intervention: the processing of data involving <code>State security</code> and defence, remains the privy of the State.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In November 2013, the CNDP published a series of recommendations on the use of biometric devices, but focused exclusively on devices used for access control in a private setting. The Commission is yet to look into the national IDs and biometric databases and answer many pressing questions, including the agency responsible for managing and storing the national databases, what safeguards exist concerning its storage, and any procedural oversight to guarantee that personal data is not exploited unlawfully by the government or third parties.</p>
<ul>
<li>As early as 2006, the country has put in place two health insurance plans. The first Assurance Maladie Obligatoire (AMO) is a payroll-based mandatory health insurance plan that covers public-and private-sector employees. <code>The second Regime d'Assistance Médicale (RAMED)</code> is a publicly financed fund to cover basic services for the poor. It had approximately 10.4 million recipients in late 2016.</li>
</ul>
<p>To benefit from the RAMED, an applicant must fill in an online form, providing data about their social and medical status and copies of their biometric ID cards. Eligible individuals receive individual electronic cards (RAMED cards) that they can use to access to basic care and emergency services.</p>
<p>Little is known about the management and storage of data related to the health insurance system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since 2009, Articles 20-30 of Act 09-08 on the protection of personal data impose restrictions on the use of personal data in scientific research: data controllers must seek an authorization from the data protection authority, the CNDP, prior to use. The CNDP sets a maximum data retention period and requests written research protocols and objectives, as well as the identity of individuals with access to the data.</li>
<li>In January 2018, the <code>European Council</code> gave the green light to the European Commission for the opening of negotiations for an agreement between the EU and Morocco (among 7 other non-EU countries) on the exchange of personal data between Europol, the law enforcement agency of the EU, and Morocco. The purported aim of the talks will be, besides addressing terrorism and organized crime, to “better address migration-related challenges such as the facilitation of irregular migration and trafficking in human beings.”</li>
<li>In 2016, Moroccan newspaper Al Massae reported that Moroccan authorities have stepped up surveillance over paid social networks in an effort “to combat terrorism … since they [paid social networks] provide their users with higher privacy and data protection.”</li>
